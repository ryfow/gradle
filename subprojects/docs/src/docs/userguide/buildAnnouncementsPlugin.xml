    <note>
        <para>
            The build announcements is experimental and should not be considered stable.
        </para>
    </note>
    <para>The build announcements plugin uses the <link linkend="announce_plugin">announce</link> plugin to send local announcements on important events in the build.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>To use the build announcements plugin, include in your build script:</para>
        <sample id="useBuildAnnouncementsPlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the build announcements plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-build-announcements-plugin"/>
        </sample>
        <para>That's it. If you want to tweak where the announcements go, you can configure the <link linkend="announce_plugin">announce</link> plugin to
            change the local announcer.
        </para>
        <para>You can also apply the plugin from an init script:</para>
        <sample id="useBuildAnnouncementsPlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the build announcements plugin from an init script">
            <sourcefile file="init.gradle"/>
            <test args="-I init.gradle"/>
        </sample>
